        Read the description on the bottom left and match it to the correct movie title. <br>
        <br>
        Each correctly guessed Movie grants you +10 Points. Guess wrong and 5 points are subtracted.<br>
        <br>
        But a movie quiz is too relaxing. This is why you are trying to defend Earth from an Alien Invasion at the same time. <br>
        <br>
        You start with a total of 3 lives. For each hit you take from the enemy bullets, one live will be taken away. If you have no more lives the game is over.<br>
        <br>
        For each enemy you shoot you'll receive +20 points and an additional 1000 points if all enemies were killed.<br>
